"""ports.memory — MemoryPort Protocol (ADR-027, extends ADR-008).

Locked in Stage 1.8. Backed by DozerDB (community Neo4j fork with enterprise
features backported permissively, per ADR-008) + Graphiti temporal index +
Agent Memory Guard v0.2.2 write-time policy filter.

Zero-trust guarantee (spec §7): every write MUST supply `provenance` and
`confidence`. Enforcement is at the port layer (this module) — non-bypassable
by any adapter or plugin. AMG runs as an additional defense-in-depth policy
layer atop the port guard, never as a replacement for it.

Canonical pattern (matches ADR-022/023/024/025/026):
- Backend-touching methods are async.
- `is_healthy()` is sync + non-throwing (ADR-023 rule 5).
- `close()` is async + idempotent.
- Typed value objects returned from reads (no raw dicts).
